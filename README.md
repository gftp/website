# Sample Website

This is a sample Website made as part of a course, [*Learn Enough Git to be dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial). It is a great tutorial for beginners. No doubt!
Once I finish the course, I'll know enough Git to be *dangerous*. I'll be able to use Git to track changes in my projects, back up data, share my work with others, and collaborate with other users of Git. No more, no less.

For official info go to: [Official Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/).
